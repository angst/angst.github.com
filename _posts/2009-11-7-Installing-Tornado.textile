title: Installing Tornado on Snow Leopard
byline: Jake Dahn
---


Tonight I had a semi-frustrating bout with attempting to get "Tornadoweb":http://tornadoweb.org to run on my macbook, which is running Snow Leopard 10.6.1 . There were a few things that were causing issues, but I finally figured out what was going on. The first issue I ran into was with py-curl installation via easy_install. The second issue was with openid authentication which needed SSL.


h3. Looking for a fix

As instructed on the tornadoweb site I ran:

{% highlight text %}
sudo easy_install setuptools pycurl==7.16.2.1 simplejson
{% endhighlight %}

However this threw out some nasty errors. So then I found that if I included a different env flag that it would install correctly.

{% highlight text %}
sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" easy_install setuptools pycurl==7.16.2.1
{% endhighlight %}

After that was installed I was able to actually run the tornadoweb chat demo, but I was getting this error: 

{% highlight text %}
Invalid OpenID response: HTTP 599: Protocol https not supported or disabled in libcurl
{% endhighlight %}

So after some more digging I discovered that the issue was that my version of curl didn't support SSL. Apparently the default install via macports doesn't include the SSL flag, so I had to reinstall what I had seen below:

{% highlight text %}
sudo port uninstall py-curl
sudo port uninstall curl
sudo port clean curl
sudo port install curl +ssl
sudo port install py-curl
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Solution Summary

If you're encountering the same issues, all you need to do is run the following items:

{% highlight text %}

sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" easy_install setuptools pycurl==7.16.2.1

sudo port uninstall py-curl
sudo port uninstall curl
sudo port clean curl
sudo port install curl +ssl
sudo port install py-curl
{% endhighlight %}


After these things were done, everything worked fine. Hopefully it's smooth sailing from here!
